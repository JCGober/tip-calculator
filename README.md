## Project: Fancy Tip Calculator
This project is a tip claculator. The user can input their bill amount and the percent they want to tip in the inputs and get back the total cost and tip amounts. They can input multiple amounts and see them all to really decide how much they want to tip. They can also click the 'tips on tipping' button to get advice for tipping their server(something we should all do)!
